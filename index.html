            <div class="text_2">
                <div class="text_2_sub" id="pre">Pre-Yakuza</div>
                Born in Mato Grosso, Brazil, under the name of <b>Ayame Yamazaki de Tales</b>, he lived there until he was 6, then he had to move back to Japan with him mom. His dad and sisters didnt acompany them, so their whereabouts are unknown. Unfortunally just a year later the yakuza, that would eventually take him under their own wings, killed his mother. Turns out, his mother was formerly affiliated with them and was the ex wife of the boss (親分).
                <div class="text_2_sub" id="ya">Yakuza</div>
                Despite being take in under the Yakuza he was never meant to actually "join" in. But his decreasing grades, amongst other things, made him quit before he even finished highschool. He joined the yakuza and quickly managed to get the respect of other members, but what kept him from reaching any rank was his gender, which at the time he still identified as a girl. This changed at the age of 21, where he finally grew the courage to come out as a trans man.
                
                Like expected, this was not welcomed in the yakuza at all, so his father challenged him, saying he could "prove his worth" in a challenge they called <b>"Meinichi" (命日)</b>. This event was completelly eradicated from any known records (Including from the CIA archives) due to it being too "disturbing". He "won", but it still wasn't enough to convince his father, so he just killed every person in a rank higher than his and then took over the yakuza. 

                His regime was fierce, feared and most importantly powerfull, earning him the nickname Akai shi (赤い死). Quickly growing influence in his area but leaving the desire to want more. So he started manufacturing guns and ammunition and selling them to whoever could offer them more in the long run. This led to them being connected to other groups that the CIA had their eyes on, wich made them an indirect target. 

                At the age of 26, only 5 years after he took over the yakuza, he simply left, leaving someone else to be the new boss..or as they now call it the new <b>"Akai Shi"</b>. The CIA seemed to not be aware of this fact, given that in Season _'s trailler, during his interrogation, <b>Terrel Wolf</b> asks him how he could've been helping <b>Perseus</b> while simultaneously in Japan administrating the Yakuza and Yama simply mocks him by saying he hasn't actually been in japan for almost 10 years now.

                After leaving the yakuza <b>Yama</b> took the new name of <b>Markus Yamazaki de Tales</b> and started selling his skills to the highest bidder. Despite never finishing school he seems to have broad knowledge in many areas and a broad knowledge in many areas namely (or especially) in martial arts, weaponry among an array of other things that made him a valuable asset to any team. 

                
                <div class="text_2_sub" id="col">Cold War Timeline</div>
                He first started working with <b>Perseus</b> before he had left the Yakuza, disponibilizing guns and weapons for him. The union seemed to come from a mutual hate for the USA. After Yama had left the Yakuza they kept in contact, with Yama working under him but now as a mercenary and a negotiator for the yakuza, eventually working under <b>Stitch</b> after Perseus's death. 

                On April 19th, 1984 after the mission in Laos, he got captured by the team led by <b>Frank Woods</b> then interrogated. During the interrogation Yama managed to outsmart them by not only convincing his team into letting him go, but by also giving them incorrect information on the whereabouts of Stitch, Perseus and Adler.

                After Stitch's death it's implied that he went back to Laos to work under <b>Naga</b>.

                <p class="text_2_text"><b>Fighting</b>: Anything that uses physical strength. Yama is very proud of how his body looks and LOVES to show it off.</a>
                <p class="text_2_text"><b>Learning</b>: Anything basically, languages, culture, birds etc. </a>
                <p class="text_2_text"><b>Nature</b>: It gives him a sense of peace. A new sense of freedom that he can’t feel anywhere else...and also he loves birds.</a>
               

                <div class="text_2_sub" id="dlike">Dislikes</div>
                <p class="text_2_text"><b>Loneliness</b>: For everything there’s a limit, and although he likes things that may cause a sense of loneliness, he’d much rather always stay near a person or two. Getting alone with his own thoughts it’s the last thing he wants now</a>
                <p class="text_2_text"><b>Drugs and Alcohol</b>:  These sorts of things that ‘mess with the brain’ were always too weak for Yama. He just feels like it's a waste of money.</a>
                
                <div class="text_2_sub" id="hob">Hobbies</div>
                <p class="text_2_text"><b>Hiking/Climbing</b>:  He loves nature…that’s it.</a>
                <p class="text_2_text"><b>Arts ‘n Crafts</b>:  He has quite the artist talent, specially when drawing birds and plants. He also loves the art of origami and other paper based sculptures. His favorite thing to do is make lots of small “Tsurus” and place them around the base or the place he’s currently at.</a>
                <p class="text_2_text"><b>Chatting</b>:  He loves social interactions, a true extrovert.</a>
                <p class="text_2_text"><b>Training</b>:  Both his brain and body. Does exercises everyday, drinks small cups of poison/other substances to build an immunity to them, studies many languages, forms of mental and emotional manipulation etc.</a>

                <div class="text_2_sub" id="love">Love Language</div>
                <p class="text_2_text"><b>Gift Giving</b>:  LOVES giving people stuff, it can be something small like an origami or the severed head of an enemy. Being that person a platonic or romantic interest…he just likes seeing the person’s reaction to a silly little gift.</a>
                <p class="text_2_text"><b>Quality Time</b>:  It can be doing a mission, cooking, hunting down an enemy soldier, or just standing there quiet. He just loves having the companion of someone he cares about, even if they’re not doing anything in particular.</a>

                <div class="text_2_sub" id="personal">Personality</div>
                <p class="text_2_text">He’s very <b>charismatic</b> and <b>optimistic</b>, keeping a smile or a smirk on regardless of the situation. Unfortunately he does sometimes get <b>bloodthirsty</b> and a little too excited during missions, wanting to cause carnage with his bare hands and as much mess as possible…just for after it, act all silly and make a “:]” face. Very good at <b>controlling his anger</b> as he himself doesn’t get mad very easily. But he gets extremely <b>overprotective</b> over people he cares about. He has and would kill someone if a friend says that person is ‘slightly annoying’. But he manages to hide that side of him very well. Even though he’s very friendly, he takes his job very seriously. Never messing up in an assigned mission. Prioritizing his team’s safety over his.</a>
